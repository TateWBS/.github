## FAQ

### How do you handle web security and data protection in your web development projects?

We handle our web security by generating multiple authentication factors that is unique for each project.

### Can you provide examples of websites or web applications you've previously developed that are similar in scope or functionality to our project?

Of course! They are listed on our [partner's page](https://www.tatewbs.com/partners).

### How do you approach the process of gathering requirements and understanding our specific needs for this project?

We start by talking with you and your team to understand what you want to achieve with your website. Then, we ask a lot of questions to make sure we know exactly what you need.

We write down all of these requirements and create pictures or diagrams to show how the website might look and work.

We'll have regular meetings to check that everything is going as planned, and we'll make changes if needed.

Before we start building the website, we'll show you what we've discussed and make sure we both agree on everything. We'll put it all in writing, so everyone knows what to expect.

As we build the website, we'll be flexible and make adjustments if necessary. Our goal is to make sure the website we create matches your goals and is user-friendly, all while staying on track with time and budget.

### Can you explain your testing and quality assurance procedures to ensure that the website will function correctly and be bug-free?

1. **Unit Testing:** We begin by testing individual components of the website, such as buttons, forms, and other interactive elements, to make sure they work as intended.

2. **Integration Testing:** After verifying individual components, we test how they work together. This helps us identify any issues that may arise when different parts of the website interact.

3. **Functional Testing:** We conduct functional tests to ensure that all features and functionalities specified in the requirements are working correctly. This includes checking forms, links, navigation, and user interactions.

4. **Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Testing:** We test the website across various browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure compatibility and a seamless user experience on all platforms.

5. **Performance Testing:** We assess the website's performance, such as load times and response times, to ensure it runs efficiently and provides a fast user experience.

6. **Security Testing:** We conduct security tests to identify and address vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors. This includes checking for common security issues like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

7. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Before launch, we involve you and your team in UAT to ensure that the website meets your expectations and aligns with your business goals.

8. **Regression Testing:** Whenever updates or changes are made to the website, we perform regression testing to ensure that new code does not introduce new bugs or disrupt existing functionality.

9. **Bug Tracking and Reporting:** Throughout the testing process, we use bug tracking systems to document and prioritize any issues we find. We then work diligently to resolve these issues.


### What is your plan for ongoing maintenance and support after the website is launched?

Based on the specific package or agreement we have in place, if we've developed your website, rest assured that it will receive ongoing updates and maintenance. Our commitment to keeping your website up-to-date and running smoothly is an integral part of our service. We understand the importance of maintaining a strong online presence, and our team is dedicated to ensuring your website continues to perform optimally.

### What is your pricing structure, including any additional costs for changes or modifications during the project? 

Our pricing structure offers flexibility to cater to your specific needs. We can arrange pricing on an hourly basis, or we can provide a comprehensive package that includes hosting, updates, and maintenance for your convenience.
